# Aaron Sofonias
IT technician · Gothenburg, Sweden 

I work as an IT technician, primarily with Microsoft 365 environments, client systems, and day-to-day troubleshooting. Alongside my job, I spend time improving my Linux skills and getting more comfortable working closer to infrastructure and automation.

Outside of work, I run a small homelab where I experiment with virtualization, containers, monitoring, and automation. I use it mainly to understand how systems behave in practice and to try things I don’t always get to touch in production.

My longer-term goal is to move toward a system administration or infrastructure-focused role, with an increasing focus on Linux and automation.

##  Tech I Use Regularly
- **Operating Systems:** Windows, Linux (Ubuntu/Debian), macOS
- **Platforms:** Microsoft 365 (Azure AD, Intune, Exchange Online, Teams)
- **Virtualization & Containers:** Proxmox, Hyper-V, Docker, LXC
- **Scripting & Automation:** Python, PowerShell

##  Currently Learning & Building
- Bash scripting for basic Linux automation and maintenance
- Python automation, including a small Proxmox monitoring project using the Proxmox API
- Completing courses on boot.dev (Linux, Git, Python, Backend/DevOps track)
